	abstract = {The NP-hard precedence-constrained production scheduling problem (PCPSP) for mine planning chooses the ordered removal of materials from the mine pit and the next processing steps based on resource, geological, and geometrical constraints. Traditionally, it prioritizes the net present value (NPV) of profits across the lifespan of the mine. Yet, the growing shift in environmental concerns also requires shifts to more carbon-aware practices. In this paper, we use the enhanced multi-objective version of the generic PCPSP formulation by adding the NPV of carbon costs as another objective. 
	We then compare how the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and the Pareto Envelope-based Selection Algorithm II (PESA-II) solve several real-world inspired datasets, after experimenting with the selection pressure parameter of PESA-II.
	The outcome reveals that PESA-II runs faster for 75\% of the datasets and gives sets of solutions that are more distributed. Meanwhile, NSGA-II consistently produces non-dominated solutions even when the apportionment of a decision variable is varied. Moreover, we assess how the uncertainty of ore tonnage at the mine site modifies the Pareto front via sensitivity analysis. We show that deviations above 15\% induce a larger gap from the original.},

	abstract = {Freight forwarding plays a crucial role in facilitating global trade and logistics. However, as the freight forwarding market is extremely fragmented, freight forwarders often face the issue of not being able to fill the available shipping capacity. This recurrent issue motivates the creation of various freight forwarding networks that aim at exchanging capacities and demands so that the resource utilization of individual freight forwarders can be maximized. In this paper, we focus on how to design such a collaborative network based on collaborative game theory, with the Shapley value representing a fair scheme for profit sharing. Noting that the exact computation of Shapley values is intractable for large-scale real-world scenarios, we incorporate the observation that collaboration among two forwarders is only possible if their service routes and demands overlap. This leads to a new class of collaborative games called the Locally Collaborative Games (LCGs), where agents can only collaborate with their neighbors. We propose an efficient approach to compute Shapley values for LCGs, and numerically demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approach for a wide variety of network structures.},

	title = {Imitating cost-constrained behaviors in reinforcement learning},
	abstract = {Complex planning and scheduling problems have long been solved using various optimization or heuristic approaches. In recent years, imitation learning that aims to learn from expert demonstrations has been proposed as a viable alternative to solving these problems. Generally speaking, imitation learning is designed to learn either the reward (or preference) model or directly the behavioral policy by observing the behavior of an expert. Existing work in imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning has focused on imitation primarily in unconstrained settings (e.g., no limit on fuel consumed by the vehicle). However, in many real-world domains, the behavior of an expert is governed not only by reward (or preference) but also by constraints. For instance, decisions on self-driving delivery vehicles are dependent not only on the route preferences/rewards (depending on past demand data) but also on the fuel in the vehicle and the time available. In such problems, imitation learning is challenging as decisions are not only dictated by the reward model but are also dependent on a cost-constrained model. In this paper, we provide multiple methods that match expert distributions in the presence of trajectory cost constraints through (a) Lagrangian-based method; (b) Meta-gradients to find a good trade-off between expected return and minimizing constraint violation; and (c) Cost-violation-based alternating gradient. We empirically show that leading imitation learning approaches imitate cost-constrained behaviors poorly and our meta-gradient-based approach achieves the best performance.},

	title = {Designing large-scale intelligent collaborative platform for freight forwarders},
	abstract = {In this paper, we propose to design a large-scale intelligent collaborative platform for freight forwarders. This platform is based on a mathematical programming formulation and an efficient solution approach. Forwarders are middlemen who procure container capacities from carriers and sell them to shippers to serve their transport requests. However, due to demand uncertainty, they often either over-procure or under-procure capacities. We address this with our proposed platform where forwarders can collaborate and share capacities, allowing one's transport requests to be potentially shipped on another forwarder's container. The result is lower total costs for all participating forwarders. The collaboration can be formulated as an integer linear program we call the Freight Forwarders' Collaboration Problem (FFCP). It is a variant of the bin-packing problem, hence it is NP-Hard. In order to solve large-scale FFCP instances efficiently, we propose a two-step approach involving an initial greedy assignment followed by a fine-tuning step. Computational experiments have shown that our approach can offer a significant reduction of run-time between 77\% and 97\%, without any loss of solution quality.},

	title = {Strategic planning for flexible agent availability in large taxi fleets},
	abstract = {In large scale multi-agent systems like taxi fleets, individual agents (taxi drivers) are self interested (maximizing their own profits) and this can introduce inefficiencies in the system. One such inefficiency is with regards to the "required" availability of taxis at different time periods during the day. Since a taxi driver can work for limited number of hours in a day (e.g., 8-10 hours in a city like Singapore), there is a need to optimize the specific hours, so as to maximize individual as well as social welfare. Technically, this corresponds to solving a large scale multi-stage selfish routing game with transition uncertainty. Existing work in addressing this problem is either unable to handle "driver" constraints (e.g., breaks during work hours) or not scalable. To that end, we provide a novel mechanism that builds on replicator dynamics through ideas from behavior cloning. We demonstrate that our methods provide significantly better policies than the existing approach in terms of improving individual agent revenue and overall agent availability.},

	title = {Preference-aware delivery planning for last-mile logistics},
	abstract = {Optimizing delivery routes for last-mile logistics service is challenging and has attracted the attention of many researchers. These problems are usually modeled and solved as variants of vehicle routing problems (VRPs) with challenging real-world constraints (e.g., time windows, precedence). However, despite many decades of solid research on solving these VRP instances, we still see significant gaps between optimized routes and the routes that are actually preferred by the practitioners. Most of these gaps are due to the difference between what's being optimized, and what the practitioners actually care about, which is hard to be defined exactly in many instances. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical route optimizer with learnable parameters that combines the strength of both the optimization and machine learning approaches. Our hierarchical router first solves a zone-level Traveling Salesman Problem with learnable weights on various zone-level features; with the zone visit sequence fixed, we then solve the stop-level vehicle routing problem as a Shortest Hamiltonian Path problem. The Bayesian optimization approach is then introduced to allow us to adjust the weights to be assigned to different zone features used in solving the zone-level Traveling Salesman Problem. By using a real-world delivery dataset provided by the Amazon Last Mile Routing Research Challenge, we demonstrate the importance of having both the optimization and the machine learning components. We also demonstrate how we can use route-related features to identify instances that we might have difficulty with. This paves ways to further research on how we can tackle these difficult instances.},

	title = {Improving quantal cognitive hierarchy model through iterative population learning},
	abstract = {In domains where agents interact strategically, game theory is applied widely to predict how agents would behave. However, game-theoretic predictions are based on the assumption that agents are fully rational and believe in equilibrium plays, which unfortunately are mostly not true when human decision makers are involved. To address this limitation, a number of behavioral game-theoretic models are defined to account for the limited rationality of human decision makers. The "quantal cognitive hierarchy" (QCH) model, which is one of the more recent models, is demonstrated to be the state-of-art model for predicting human behaviors in normal-form games. The QCH model assumes that agents in games can be both non-strategic (level-0) and strategic (level-k). For level-0 agents, they choose their strategies irrespective of other agents. For level-k agents, they assume that other agents would be behaving at levels less than k and best respond against them. However, an important assumption of the QCH model is that the distribution of agents' levels follows a Poisson distribution. In this paper, we relax this assumption and design a learning-based method at the population level to iteratively estimate the empirical distribution of agents' reasoning levels. By using a real-world dataset from the Swedish lowest unique positive integer game, we demonstrate how our refined QCH model and the iterative solution-seeking process can be used in providing a more accurate behavioral model for agents. This leads to better performance in fitting the real data and allows us to track an agent's progress in learning to play strategically over multiple rounds.},

We find that even in a unique market like Singapore, where incumbent taxi companies have app-based booking systems similar to those from ride-hailing companies like Uber, the estimated upper bound on the cross-platform substitution between ride-hailing services and taxi bookings is only 0.26. On the other hand, we show that incorporating surge price factor improves the precision of demand prediction by 12% to 15%. Our structural analyses based on a driver guidance system finds this improved accuracy in demand prediction reduces drivers' vacant roaming times by 9.4% and increases the average number of trips per taxi by 2.6%, suggesting the price information is valuable across platforms, even if elasticities are low.},

Unlike current industry practice, which relies on broadcasting to attract taxis to come and serve the queue, we propose more proactive and adaptive approaches to handle demand surges. Our design objective is to reduce the cumulative supply-demand gaps as much as we could by sending notifications to individual taxis. To address this problem, we first propose a highly effective passenger demand prediction system that is based on the real-time flight arrival information. By monitoring cumulative passenger arrivals, and control for factors such as the flight's departure cities, we demonstrate that a simple linear regression model can accurately predict the number of passengers joining taxi queues. We then propose an optimal control strategy based on a Markov Decision Process to model the decisions of notifying individual taxis that are at different distances away from the airport. By using a real-world dataset, we demonstrate that an accurate passenger demand prediction system is crucial to the effectiveness of taxi queue management. In our numerical studies based on the real-world data, we observe that our proposed approach of optimal control with demand predictions outperforms the same control strategy, yet with Poisson demand assumption, by 43%. Against the status quo, which has no external control, we could reduce the gap by 23%. These results demonstrate that our proposed methodology has strong real-world potential.},

	abstract = {In recent years we have increasingly seen the movement for the retail industry to move their operations online. Along the process, it has created brand new patterns for the fulfillment service, and the logistics service providers serving these retailers have no choice but to adapt. The most challenging issues faced by all logistics service providers are the highly fluctuating demands and the shortening response times. All these challenges imply that maintaining a fixed fleet will either be too costly or insufficient. One potential solution is to tap into the crowdsourced workforce. However, existing industry practices of relying on human planners or worker's self-planning have been shown to be inefficient and laborious. In this paper, we introduce a centralized planning model for the crowdsourced logistics delivery paradigm, considering individual worker's spatio-temporal preferences. Considering worker's spatio-temporal preferences is important for the planner as it could significantly improve crowdsourced worker's productivity. Our major contributions are in the formulation of the problem as a mixed-integer program and the proposal of an efficient algorithm that is based on the column generation and the Lagrangian relaxation frameworks. Such a hybrid approach allows us to overcome the difficulty encountered separately by the classical column generation and Lagrangian relaxation approaches. By using a series of real-world-inspired numerical instances, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach against classical column generation and Lagrangian relaxation approaches, and a decentralized, agent-centric greedy approach. Our proposed hybrid approach is scalable to large problem instances, with reasonable solution quality, and achieves better allocation fairness.},

Taxis and cars in taxi fleets and car aggregation systems (e.g., Uber) are dependent on a large number of self-controlled and profit-driven taxi drivers, which introduces inefficiencies in the system. There are two ways in which taxi fleet performance can be optimized: (i) Operational decision making: improve assignment of taxis/cars to customers, while accounting for future demand; (ii) strategic decision making: optimize operating hours of (taxi and car) drivers. Existing research has primarily focused on the operational decisions in (i) and we focus on the strategic decisions in (ii).We first model this complex real-world decision making problem (with thousands of taxi drivers) as a multi-stage stochastic congestion game with a non-dedicated set of agents (i.e., agents start operation at a random stage and exit the game after a fixed time), where there is a dynamic population of agents (constrained by the maximum number of drivers). We provide planning and learning methods for computing the ideal operating hours in such a game, so as to improve efficiency of the overall fleet. In our experimental results, we demonstrate that our planning-based approach provides up to 16% improvement in revenue over existing method on a real-world taxi dataset. The learning-based approach further improves the performance and achieves up to 10% more revenue than the planning approach.},

One promising solution is to engage crowdsourced workers, who are not employed full-time but would be willing to help with the deliveries if their schedules permit. The challenge, however, is to choose appropriate sets of tasks that would not cause too much disruption from their intended routes, while satisfying each delivery task's delivery time window requirement. In this paper, we propose a decision-support algorithm to select delivery tasks for a single crowdsourced worker that best fit his/her upcoming route both in terms of additional travel time and the time window requirements at all stops along his/her route, while at the same time satisfies tasks' delivery time windows. Our major contributions are in the formulation of the problem and the design of an efficient exact algorithm based on the branch-and-cut approach. The major innovation we introduce is the efficient generation of promising valid inequalities via our separation heuristics. In all numerical instances we study, our approach manages to reach optimality yet with much fewer computational resource requirement than the plain integer linear programming formulation. The greedy heuristic, while efficient in time, only achieves around 40-60% of the optimum in all cases. To illustrate how our solver could help in advancing the sustainability objective, we also quantify the reduction in the carbon footprint.},

	abstract = {In mobile crowd-sourcing systems, simply relying on people to opportunistically select and perform tasks typically leads to drawbacks such as low task acceptance/completion rates and undesirable spatial skews. In this paper, we utilize data from "Smart Campus", a campus-based mobile crowd-sourcing platform, to empirically study and discover whether and how various context-aware notification strategies can help overcome such drawbacks. We first study worker interactions, in the absence of any notifications, to discover some spatio-temporal properties of task acceptance and completion. Based on these insights, we then experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of two novel, non-personal, context-driven notification strategies, comparing the outcomes to two different baselines (no-notification and random-notification). Finally, using the data from the random-notification mechanism, we derive a classification model, incorporating several novel contextual features, that can predict a worker's responsiveness to notifications with high accuracy. Our work extends the crowd-sourcing literature by emphasizing the power of smart notifications for greater worker engagement.},

	abstract = {Community detection has been widely studied in the areas of social network analysis and recommendation system. However, most existing research focus on cases where relationships are explicit or depend on simultaneous appearance. In this paper, we propose to study the community detection problem where the relationships are not based on simultaneous appearance, but time-delayed appearances. In other words, we aim to capture the relationship where one individual physically follows another individual. In our attempt to capture such relationships, the major challenge is the presence of spatial homophily, i.e., individuals are attracted to locations due to their popularities and not because of communications. In tackling the community detection problem with spatial homophily and delayed responses, we make the following key contributions: (1) We introduce a four-phase framework, which by way of using quantified impacts excludes homophily. (2) To validate the framework, we generate a synthetic dataset based on a known community structure and then infer that community structure. (3) Finally, we execute this framework on a real-world dataset with more than 6,000 taxis in Singapore. Our results are also compared to those of a baseline approach without homophily-elimination.},

The recent empirical studies have shown that compared to the pull-based approach, which expects the users to browse through the list of tasks to perform, the push-based approach that actively recommends tasks can greatly improve the overall system performance. As the efficiency of the push-based approach is achieved by incorporating worker's mobility traces, privacy is naturally a concern. In this paper, we propose a novel, 2-stage and user-controlled obfuscation technique that provides a trade off-amenable framework that caters to multi-attribute privacy measures (considering the per-user sensitivity and global uniqueness of locations). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by testing it using the real-world data collected from the well-established TA$Ker platform. More specifically, we show that one can increase its location entropy by 23% with only modest changes to the real trajectories while imposing an additional 24% (< 1 min) of detour overhead on average. Finally, we present insights derived by carefully inspecting various parameters that control the whole obfuscation process.},

The task recommendation platform that we design can match tasks to crowdworkers based on workers' historical trajectories and time budget limits, thus making recommendations personal and efficient. One major challenge we manage to address is the handling of crowdworker's trajectory uncertainties. In this article, we explicitly allow multiple routine routes to be probabilistically associated with each worker. We formulate this problem as an integer linear program whose goal is to maximize the expected total utility achieved by all workers. We further exploit the separable structures of the formulation and apply the Lagrangian relaxation technique to scale up computation. Numerical experiments have been performed over the instances generated using the realistic public transit dataset in Singapore. The results show that we can find significantly better solutions than the deterministic formulation, and in most cases we can find solutions that are very close to the theoretical performance limit. To demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we deployed our recommendation engine to a campus-scale field trial, and we demonstrate that workers receiving our recommendations incur fewer detours and complete more tasks, and are more efficient against workers relying on their own planning (25% more for top workers who receive recommendations). This is achieved despite having highly uncertain worker trajectories. We also demonstrate how to further improve the robustness of the system by using a simple multi-coverage mechanism.},

We focus specifically on dynamically varying the transmission power of the deployed BLE beacons, so as to extend their operational lifetime without sacrificing the frequency of sensor data retrieval. We propose a memetic algorithm-based power adaptation strategy that can handle deployments of thousands of beacons and tackles two distinct objectives: (1) maximizing BLE beacon lifetime, and (2) reducing the BLE scanning energy of the mules. Using real-world movement traces on the Singapore Management University campus, we show that the benefit of such mule movement-aware power adaptation: it provides reliably frequent retrieval of BLE sensor data, while achieving a significant (5-fold) increase in the sensor lifetime, compared to a traditional fixed-power approach.},

If the taxi service is reliable, responsive, and cost-effective, past studies show that taxi-like services can be a viable choice in replacing a significant amount of private cars. However, making taxi services efficient is extremely challenging, mainly due to the fact that taxi drivers are self-interested and they operate with only local information. Although past research has demonstrated how recommendation systems could potentially help taxi drivers in improving their performance, most of these efforts are not feasible in practice. This is mostly due to the lack of both the comprehensive data coverage and an efficient recommendation engine that can scale to tens of thousands of drivers. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive working platform called the Driver Guidance System (DGS). With real-time citywide taxi data provided by our collaborator in Singapore, we demonstrate how we can combine real-time data analytics and large-scale optimization to create a guidance system that can potentially benefit tens of thousands of taxi drivers. Via a realistic agent-based simulation, we demonstrate that drivers following DGS can significantly improve their performance over ordinary drivers, regardless of the adoption ratios.

The success of the mobile crowd-sourcing platform depends mainly on its effectiveness in engaging crowd-workers, and recent studies have shown that compared to the pull-based approach, which relies on crowd-workers to browse and commit to tasks they would want to perform, the push-based approach can take into consideration of worker's daily routine, and generate highly effective recommendations. As a result, workers waste less time on detours, plan more in advance, and require much less planning effort. However, the push-based systems are not without drawbacks. The major concern is the potential privacy invasion that could result from the disclosure of individual's mobility traces to the crowd-sourcing platform. In this paper, we first demonstrate specific threats of continuous sharing of users locations in such push-based crowd-sourcing platforms. We then propose a simple yet effective location perturbation technique that obfuscates certain user locations to achieve privacy guarantees while not affecting the quality of the recommendations the system generates.We use the mobility traces data we obtained from our urban campus to show the trade-offs between privacy guarantees and the quality of the recommendations associated with the proposed solution. We show that obfuscating even 75% of the individual trajectories will affect the user to make another extra 1.8 minutes of detour while gaining 62.5% more uncertainty of his location traces.},

In this work, we solve MAOPCC in a centralized manner and optimize the total collected rewards of all agents. A branch and bound algorithm is first proposed to find an optimal MAOPCC solution. Since finding an optimal solution for MAOPCC can become intractable as the number of vertices and agents increases, a computationally efficient sequential algorithm that sacrifices the solution quality is then proposed. Finally, a probabilistic iterated local search algorithm is developed to find a sufficiently good solution in a reasonable time. Our experimental results show that the latter strikes a good tradeoff between the solution quality and the computational time incurred.},

To the best of our knowledge, most-if not all-of the UCCs operate on volume-based fixed-rate charges. To achieve environmental sustainability while ensuring economic sustainability in urban logistics, we propose, in this paper, a bicriteria auction mechanism for the automated assignment of last-mile delivery orders to transport resources. We formulate and solve the winner determination problem of the auction as a biobjective programming model. We then present a systematic way to generate the Pareto frontier to characterize the tradeoff between achieving economic and environmental sustainabilities in urban logistics. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed bicriteria auction produces the solutions that significantly dominate those obtained from the fixed-rate mechanisms. Our sensitivity analysis on the willingness of carriers to participate in the UCC operation reveals that higher willingness is favorable toward achieving greater good for all, if UCC is designed to be nonprofit and self-sustaining.Note to Practitioners-One of the main issues with last-mile logistics is the low utilization of delivery trucks, resulting in unnecessarily large number of trucks carrying out the last-mile delivery. This creates congestion, worsens air pollution, and drives up the cost of the individual carriers. Consolidation of orders can reduce the total number of trucks used to perform the last-mile delivery. This can considerably improve the environmental sustainability around the delivery area and reduce the cost of the individual carrier. Without the proper mechanism, however, such consolidation is often not economically sustainable, requiring the government to continually inject subsidy. To address the issue, we propose, in this paper, a bicriteria auction that considers both the economic and environmental sustainability aspects when performing winner determination. We then present a systematic way to characterize the tradeoff between the two objectives. Finally, we show that our proposal leads to the solutions that dominate those obtained from the commonly used fixed-rate mechanisms.},

In this paper, we address this problem using the framework of computational cooperative games. We first present cooperative vehicle routing game as a model for collaborative logistics operations. Using the axioms of Shapley value as the conditions for fairness, we show that a stable, fair and budget balanced allocation does not exist in many instances of the game. By relaxing budget balance, we then propose an allocation scheme based on the normalized Shapley value. We show that this scheme maintains stability and fairness while requiring minimum subsidy.

In these settings, we are interested in accurately estimating aggregate crowd-related movement statistics.

A key characteristic of such dependent cascade models is the flow preservation at all nodes in the network. For example, traffic and people flow is preserved at each network node. As a case study, we address learning visitor mobility pattern at a theme park based on observed historical wait times at individual attractions, and use the learned model to plan management actions that reduce wait time at attractions.

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a variant of the density peaks clustering (DPC) approach for discovering demand hot spots from a low-frequency, low-quality taxi fleet operational dataset. From the literature, the DPC approach mainly uses density peaks as features to discover potential cluster centers, and this requires distances between all pairs of data points to be calculated. This implies that the DPC approach can only be applied to cases with relatively small numbers of data points. For the domain of urban taxi operations that we are interested in, we could have millions of demand points per day, and calculating all-pair distances between all demand points would be practically impossible, thus making DPC approach not applicable. To address this issue, we project all points to a density image and execute our variant of the DPC algorithm on the processed image. Experiment results show that our proposed DPC variant could get similar results as original DPC, yet with much shorter execution time and lower memory consumption. By running our DPC variant on a real-world dataset collected in Singapore, we show that there are indeed recurrent demand hot spots within the central business district that are not covered by the current taxi stand design. Our approach could be of use to both taxi fleet operator and traffic planners in guiding drivers and setting up taxi stands.},

MOPTCC is similar to the classical orienteering problem at single-agent level: given a limited time budget, an agent travels around the network and collects rewards by visiting different nodes, with the objective of maximizing the sum of his collected rewards. The most important feature we introduce in MOPTCC is the inclusion of multiple competing agents. All agents in MOPTCC are assumed to be self-interested, and they interact with each other when arrive at certain nodes simultaneously. As all nodes are capacitated, if a particular node receives more agents than its capacity, all agents at that node will be made to wait and agents suffer as a result (in terms of extra time needed for queueing). Due to the decentralized nature of the problem, MOPTCC cannot be solved in a centralized manner, instead, we need to seek out equilibrium solutions, and if not possible, at least approximated equilibrium solutions. The major contribution of this paper is the formulation of the problem, and our first attempt in identifying an efficient and effective equilibrium-seeking procedure for MOPTCC.},

Their distinguishing feature is that the decision in each state is a multi-dimensional vector. These problems can in principle be solved using Bellman's backward recursion. However, complexity of this procedure grows exponentially in the dimension of the decision vectors. This is called the curse of action-space dimensionality. To overcome this computational challenge, we propose an approximation algorithm rooted in the game theoretic paradigm of Sampled Fictitious Play (SFP). SFP solves a sequence of DPs with a one-dimensional action-space, which are exponentially smaller than the original multi-action stochastic DP. In particular, the computational effort in a fixed number of SFP iterations is linear in the dimension of the decision vectors. We show that the sequence of SFP iterates converges to a local optimum, and present a numerical case study in manufacturing where SFP is able to find solutions with objective values within 1% of the optimal objective value hundreds of times faster than the time taken by backward recursion. In this case study, SFP solutions are also better by a statistically significant margin than those found by a one-step lookahead heuristic.},

	abstract = {We investigate the problem of large-scale mobile crowd-tasking, where a large pool of citizen crowd-workers are used to perform a variety of location-specific urban logistics tasks. Current approaches to such mobile crowd-tasking are very decentralized: a crowd-tasking platform usually provides each worker a set of available tasks close to the worker's current location; each worker then independently chooses which tasks she wants to accept and perform. In contrast, we propose TRACCS, a more coordinated task assignment approach, where the crowd-tasking platform assigns a sequence of tasks to each worker, taking into account their expected location trajectory over a wider time horizon, as opposed to just instantaneous location. We formulate such task assignment as an optimization problem, that seeks to maximize the total payoff from all assigned tasks, subject to a maximum bound on the detour (from the expected path) that a worker will experience to complete her assigned tasks. We develop credible computationally-efficient heuristics to address this optimization problem (whose exact solution requires solving a complex integer linear program), and show, via simulations with realistic topologies and commuting patterns, that a specific heuristic (called Greedy-ILS) increases the fraction of assigned tasks by more than 20%, and reduces the average detour overhead by more than 60%, compared to the current decentralized approach.},

This is commonly known as the last-mile problem and is critical in promoting the utilization of public transportation system. In this paper, we address the last-mile problem by considering a dynamic and demand-responsive mechanism for arranging ride sharing on a non-dedicated commercial fleet (such as taxis or passenger vans). Our approach has the benefits of being dynamic, flexible, and with low setup cost. A critical issue in such ride-sharing service is how riders should be grouped and serviced, and how fares should be split. We propose two auction designs which are used to solicit individual rider's willing payment rate and compensation rate (for extra travel, if any). We demonstrate that these two auctions are budget balanced, individually rational, and incentive compatible. A series of experimental studies based on both synthetic and real-world datasets are designed to demonstrate the pros and cons of our two proposed auction mechanisms in various settings.},

For reasons of safety, testing, and access, task performance often requires the vicinity of impacted equipment to be left in a specific "end state" when production halts. Therefore, planning the shutdown of a production system to balance production goals against enabling non-production tasks yields a challenging optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a mathematical formulation of this problem and a dynamic programming approach that efficiently finds optimal shutdown policies for deterministic serial production lines. An event-triggered re-optimization procedure that is based on the proposed deterministic dynamic programming approach is also introduced for handling uncertainties in the production line for the stochastic case. We demonstrate numerically that in these cases with random breakdowns and repairs, the re-optimization procedure is efficient and even obtains results that are optimal or nearly optimal.},

Since all visitors are heterogeneous and self-interested, we argue that a high-quality agent-based simulation is necessary for studying various problems related to experience management. As in most agent-base simulations, a sound understanding of micro-level behaviors is essential to construct high-quality models. To achieve this, we designed and conducted a first-of-its-kind real-world experiment that helps us understand how typical visitors behave in a theme-park environment. From the data collected, visitor behaviors are quantified, modeled, and eventually incorporated into a massive agent-based simulation where up to 15,000 visitor agents are modeled. Finally, we demonstrate how our agent-based simulator can be used to understand the crowd build-up and the impacts of various control policies on visitor experience.},

	abstract = {The myth that financial trading is an art has been mostly destroyed in the recent decade due to the proliferation of algorithmic trading. In equity markets, algorithmic trading has already bypass human traders in terms of traded volume. This trend seems to be irreversible, and other asset classes are also quickly becoming dominated by the machine traders. However, for asset that requires deeper understanding of physicality, like the trading of commodities, human traders still have significant edge over machines. The primary advantage of human traders in such market is the qualitative expert knowledge that requires traders to consider not just the financial information, but also a wide variety of physical constraints and information. However, due to rapid technology changes and the "invasion" of cashrich hedge funds, even this traditionally human-centric asset class is crying for help in handling increasingly complicated and volatile environment. In this paper, we propose an adaptive trading support framework that allows us to quantify expert's knowledge to help human traders. Our method is based on a two-state switching Kalman filter, which updates its state estimation continuously with real-time information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in palm oil trading, which is becoming more and more complicated in recent years due to its new usage in producing biofuel.We show that the two-state switching Kalman filter tuned with expert domain knowledge can effectively reduce prediction errors when compared against traditional single-state econometric models. With a simple back test, we also demonstrate that even a slight decrease in the prediction errors can lead to significant improvement in the trading performance of a naive trading algorithm.},

	abstract = {Unprecedented pace of urbanization and rising income levels have fueled the growth of car ownership in almost all newly formed megacities. Such growth has congested the limited road space and significantly affected the quality of life in these megacities. Convincing residents to give up their cars and use public transport is the most effective way in reducing congestion; however, even with sufficient public transport capacity, the lack of last-mile (from the transport hub to the destination) travel services is the major deterrent for the adoption of public transport. Due to the dynamic nature of such travel demands, fixed-size fleets will not be a cost-effective approach in addressing last-mile demands. Instead, we propose a dynamic, incentive-based mechanism that enables taxi ridesharing for satisfying last-mile travel demands. On the demand side, travelers would register their last-mile travel demands in real-time, and they are expected to receive ride arrangements before they reach the hub; on the supply side, depending on the real-time demands, proper incentives will be computed and provided to taxi drivers willing to commit to the lastmile service. Multiple travelers will be clustered into groups according to their destinations, and travelers belonging to the same group will be assigned to a taxi, while each of them paying fares considering their destinations and also their orders in reaching destinations. In this paper, we provide mathematical formulations for demand clustering and fare distribution. If the model returns a solution, it is guaranteed to be implementable. For cases where it is not possible to satisfy all demands despite having enough capacity, we propose a two-phase approach that identifies the maximal subset of riders that can be feasibly served. Finally, we use a series of numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

	abstract = {Congestion games model a wide variety of real-world resource congestion problems, such as selfish network routing, traffic route guidance in congested areas, taxi fleet optimization and crowd movement in busy areas. However, existing research in congestion games assumes: (a) deterministic movement of agents between resources; and (b) perfect rationality (i.e. maximizing their own expected value) of all agents. Such assumptions are not reasonable in dynamic domains where decision support has to be provided to humans. For instance, in optimizing the performance of a taxi fleet serving a city, movement of taxis can be involuntary or nondeterministic (decided by the specific customer who hires the taxi) and more importantly, taxi drivers may not follow advice provided by the decision support system (due to bounded rationality of humans). To that end, we contribute: (a) a general framework for representing congestion games under uncertainty for populations with assorted notions of rationality. (b) a scalable approach for solving the decision problem for perfectly rational agents which are in the mix with boundedly rational agents; and (c) a detailed evaluation on a synthetic and real world data set to illustrate the usefulness of our new approach with respect to key social welfare metrics in the context of an assorted human-agent population. An interesting result from our experiments on a real-world taxi fleet optimization problem is that it is better (in terms of revenue and operational efficiency) for taxi drivers to follow perfectly rational strategies irrespective of the percentage of drivers not following the advice.},

	abstract = {In hotly contested product categories dominated by a few powerful firms, it is quite common for weaker or late entrants to focus only on particular segments of the whole market. The rationale for such strategy is intuitive: to avoid direct confrontation with heavy-weight firms, and to concentrate in segments where these weaker firms have comparative advantages. In marketing, this is what people called "go niche or go home". The niche-building strategy may rely on "homophily", which implies that consumers in a particular market segment might possess certain set of attributes that cause them to appreciate certain products better (in other words, weaker firms would customize their products to target some particular market segments and not the mass market). On the other hand, the niche-building strategy may also rely on the network effect, which implies that consumers having social relationship would reinforce each other via their respective adoptions. In this case, weaker firms should recognize such inter-customer network and concentrate only on customers belonging to certain set of strategic clusters. In this paper, we present the model for building effective niche-seeking strategies. For simplicity, we assume that the adoption choice depends only on the network effects (in other words, a customer will choose the product that is chosen by the majority of her neighbor). The social network is directed, and there will be two firms, one with significantly more marketing budget than the other firm. Firms take turns making investment choices on which customer to convert. For both firms, their budgets are fixed over time and unused budget will not carry over to future time periods. With this model, we manage to show that a simple strategy based on the evaluation of individual customer's "value" can effectively identify and secure niches within randomly generated scale-free networks. We also show that such niche-building strategy indeed performs better in the long run than a myopic strategy that only cares about immediate market gains.},

	abstract = {This research is motivated by large scale problems in urban transportation and labor mobility where there is congestion for resources and uncertainty in movement. In such domains, even though the individual agents do not have an identity of their own and do not explicitly interact with other agents, they effect other agents. While there has been much research in handling such implicit effects, it has primarily assumed deterministic movements of agents. We address the issue of decision support for individual agents that are identical and have involuntary movements in dynamic environments. For instance, in a taxi fleet serving a city, when a taxi is hired by a customer, its movements are uncontrolled and depend on (a) the customers requirement; and (b) the location of other taxis in the fleet. Towards addressing decision support in such problems, we make two key contributions: (a) A framework to represent the decision problem for selfish individuals in a dynamic population, where there is transitional uncertainty (involuntary movements); and (b) Two techniques (Fictitious Play for Symmetric Agent Populations, FP-SAP and Softmax based Flow Update, SMFU) that converge to equilibrium solutions.We show that our techniques (apart from providing equilibrium strategies) outperform "driver" strategies with respect to overall availability of taxis and the revenue obtained by the taxi drivers. We demonstrate this on a real world data set with 8,000 taxis and 83 zones (representing the entire area of Singapore).},

	abstract = {Taxi service is an important mode of public transportation in most metropolitan areas since it provides door-to-door convenience in the public domain. Unfortunately, despite all the convenience taxis bring, taxi ﬂeets are also extremely inefficient to the point that over 50% of its operation time could be spent in idling state. Improving taxi ﬂeet operation is an extremely challenging problem, not just because of its scale, but also due to fact that taxi drivers are self-interested agents that cannot be controlled centrally. To facilitate the study of such complex and decentralized system, we propose to construct a multiagent simulation platform that would allow researchers to investigate interactions among taxis and to evaluate the impact of implementing certain management policies. The major contribution of our work is the incorporation of our analysis on the real-world driver’s behaviors. Despite the fact that taxi drivers are selﬁsh and unpredictable, by analyzing a huge GPS dataset collected from a major taxi ﬂeet operator, we are able to clearly demonstrate that driver’s movements are closely related to the relative attractiveness of neighboring regions. By applying this insight, we are able to design a background agent movement strategy that generates aggregate performance patterns that are very similar to the real-world ones. Finally, we demonstrate the value of such system with a real-world case study.},

	abstract = {On May 6, 2010, the US equity markets experienced a brief but highly unusual drop in prices across a number of stocks and indices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by approximately 9% in a matter of minutes, and several stocks were traded down sharply before recovering a short time later. Earlier research by Lee, Cheng and Koh (2010) identified the conditions under which a "flash crash" can be triggered by systematic traders running highly similar trading strategies, especially when they are "crowding out" other liquidity providers in the market. The authors contend that the events of May 6, 2010 exhibit patterns consistent with the type of "flash crash" observed in their earlier study (2010). While some commentators assigned blame to high-frequency trading, our analysis was unable to identify a direct link to high-frequency trading per se, but rather the domination of market activities by trading strategies that are responding to the same set of market variables in similar ways, as well as various pre-existing market micro-structural safety mechanisms with unintended consequences when triggered simultaneously. The consequent lack of market participants interested in the "other side" of their trades may result in a significant liquidity withdrawal during extreme market movements. This paper describes the results of 9 different simulations created by using a large-scale computer model to reconstruct the critical elements of the market events of May 6, 2010. The resulting price distribution provides a reasonable resemblance to the descriptive statistics of the second-by-second prices of S&P500 e-Mini futures from 14:30 to 15:00 on May 6, 2010. There are no a priori assumptions made on asset price distributions, and our description of market dynamics is purely based on the structure of the market and the key types of market participants involved. This type of simulation avoids "over-fitting" historical data, and can therefore provide regulators with deeper insights on the possible drivers of the "flash crash", as well as what type of policy responses may work or may not work under comparable market circumstances in the future. Our results also lead to a natural question for policy markers: If certain prescriptive measures such as position limits have a low probability of meeting its policy objectives on a day like May 6, will there be any other more effective counter measures without unintended consequences?},

We can apply elimination of δ-dominated strategies iteratively, but the for which a strategy may be eliminated depends on prior eliminations. We discuss implications of this order independence, and propose greedy heuristics for determining a sequence of eliminations to reduce the game as far as possible while keeping down costs.

The algorithm is robustly scalable to realistic-size networks modeled with high-fidelity simulations. Results of a case study for the city of Troy, MI, where there are 75 signalized intersections, are reported. Under normal traffic conditions, savings in average travel time of more than 20% are experienced against a static timing plan, and even against an aggressively tuned automatic-signal-retiming algorithm, savings of more than 10% are achieved. The efficiency of the algorithm stems from its parallel nature. With a thousand parallel CPUs available, the algorithm finds the plan above under 10 min, while a version of a hill-climbing algorithm makes virtually no progress in the same amount of wall-clock computational time.},

	abstract = {The annual trading agent competition offers agent designers a forum for evaluating programmed trading techniques in a challenging market scenario. TAC aims to spur research by enabling researchers to compare techniques on a common problem and build on each other's ideas. A fixed set of assumptions and environment settings facilitates communication of methods and results. As a multiyear event, TAC lets researchers observe trading agents' progress over time, in effect accelerating the evolution of an adapted population of traders. Given all the participant effort invested, it is incumbent on us to learn as much from the experience as possible. After three years of TAC, we're ready to examine there we stand. To do this, we used data from actual TAC tournaments and some post-competition experimentation. We based our analysis almost entirely on outcomes (profits and allocations), with very little direct accounting for specific agent techniques.},
